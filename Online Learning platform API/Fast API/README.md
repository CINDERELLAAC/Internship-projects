# Online learning Platform API

This is a trial attempt at creating an Online learning Platform API with the help of FastAPI framework and portraying my skills.



The following is being implemented in this project :

*API Development: Implementing routes for managing courses (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE), enrollments, and instructor/student profiles. 

*CRUD Operations: Handling create, read, update, and delete operations for courses and user data. 

*Query Parameters: Filtering courses by category, instructor, or difficulty level using query parameters.
